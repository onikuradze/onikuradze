        Before I started to create my interactive visualization I first had to find the data I wanted to use. At first I
        was interested in creating a visualization that was centered around gaming in a way, but I did not know exactly
        what I wanted to create. I ultimately decided on using twitch streamers for my data. I found a great site that
        allows you to select what attribute you are interested in seeing. The dataset I used for my visulization can be
        found here <a href="https://sullygnome.com/channels/30/mostfollowers">Twitch Dataset</a>.
        After I figured out what dataset I was going to use for my visulization, I knew it was time I formed a question
        about the dataset. I looked over the attributes and I
        knew I wanted to answer the following question “What are the top 100 channels on Twitch that have the most
        followers.” I figured this would be a great question because of how many cahnnels there are on twitch and
        limiting the data to 100 would be easier for a viewer to understand the visualization. In my next step I started
        to sketch up a
        visualization and this is where I figured out I wanted it to be a barchart. As seen below in sketch 1.1 I first
        came up with a sketch of a barchart where the X and Y axis were flipped. After looking at it for awhile I
        decided it woudl not
        be the best fit for what I was trying to do. I decided it would be best if I stuck with the tradinoal syle of
        barcharts with X being horizonal and Y being vertical.
        I figured this would be the best choice because it would be easier for viewers to understand my visulization and
        the information I am trying to get across.

        Once my sketches were completed I knew it was time to start the process of coding.
        Before I started to create my visualization I started with a website like template.
        I did this because it would be easier for viewers to find what they are looking for.
        I created a navigation bar located at the top of the website so viewers can navigate to the visualization or to
        the documentation page.
        I decided to add a footer to the website too. I did this so when a viewer scrolls down on the page they can
        easily navigate back to the visualization or to the documentation page. Once I had the nav bar and footer
        set up I moved on to create the interactive visualization.
        I first started by creating a simple barchart that was in ascending order. After looking at the barchart for
        awhile
        I noticed that it looked odd if it was in ascending order so I decided descending order was the best way to go.
        After
        I was done figuring out what
        order I wanted the data to go, I decided on a color and I went with the color of the Twitch logo that being a
        lightish purple color.
        I used this color on the title of the barchart, subtitle, and the individual bars within the chart.
        Once I figured out the order of the data and the color of the bars within the chart It was time to add an
        animation to the chart. At first I was going to use an animation that would fade the bars in, but after some
        testing I found that animation to not work as well as I thought it would. I decided to go with an animation that
        would follow each individual bar in the chart as it loads the data. I did this because it makes the first value
        in the chart stand
        out the most when compared to the rest of the values in the dataset. After I was done with the animation I
        decided to add a mouseover funtion.
        I did this because I wanted viewers to be able to hgihlight the individual bars in the chart to make it easier
        to understand the data.

        After I was done creating my visulization I looked back at my intail question to see if it was answered propery
        with my visulization.
        My intail question was “What are the top 100 channels on Twitch that have the most followers.” Once I finished
        my visulization I started to notice
        the channel Ninja has a massive follower acocunt compared to other channels on Twitch.tv. Ninja has over
        17million followers. As shown below in Screenshot 1.3 you can see
        how high the bar goes for Ninja. After looking at the channel with the most followers I looked at the channel
        that comes in 100th place on the chart and that is ELSpreen.
        ElSpreen has over 2million followers but when compared to Ninja that is nothing. As you can see below in
        Screenshot 1.4 the channel ElSpreen is in 100th place on the chart.
        Another question I thought would be interesting is the possiblity of looking at what the top streamers stream
        mostly. This would help figure out what content is being followed
        the most on Twitch.
